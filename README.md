# Whac-A-Mole

Inspired by the classic arcade game, I recreated the game with JavaScript and WebGL. The game features a floating hammer, moles, bombs, and a grass field for the moles. <br />
<br />
- 'r' : initially play or restart game <br />
- 'p' : toggles pause state <br />
<br />
The game can be played by using the mouse or the keys q, w, e, a, s, d, z, x, or c. <br />
The position on the keyboard correspond to the holes that will be "hit." <br />
The hammer will follow the cursor when the cursor is in the canvas.
